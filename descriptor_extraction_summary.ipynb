    "This notebook summarizes the steps I took to create a database of flavor chemicals and their flavor descriptors based on information found in two sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) website\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives  (JECFA) website\n",

    "\n",
    "### The FEMA website\n",
    "\n",
    "The FEMA website contains a series of [library pages](https://www.femaflavor.org/flavor/library?page=) that list all of the FEMA chemicals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chemical then has its own page (for example, [acetic acid](https://www.femaflavor.org/acetic-acid-2)) from which I will extract:\n",
    "- Flavor descriptors\n",
    "- Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry number\n",
    "- JECFA number\n",
    "- US Government's Code of Ferderal Regulations (CFR) citation\n",
